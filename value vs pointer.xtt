Passing by value: 
- a copy of the actual parameter is created and passed to the function.
- Changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable from the caller.
- safe from unintended modifications within the function, as it operates on a copy.

Passing by pointer: 
- pass the memory address of the variable rather than a copy of its value.
- allows the function to directly access and modify the original variable.
- changes made to the parameter inside the function affect the original variable.
- can be more efficient for large data structures as they avoid making
